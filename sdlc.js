// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

    //Planning 
    //Analysis of Requirements
    //Design
    //Testing & Integration
    //Implementaion
    //Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "The analysis includes gathering all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas for prototypes.";
const design = "The design stage is when developers define the technical details of the product. These details can include screen designs, databases, sketches, system interfaces, and prototypes.";
const testingAndIntegration = "During the testing stage, developers will carefully go over their software, looking for bugs or defects that need to be tracked, fixed, and later retested.";
const implementation = "Different designs will be integrated into the primary code usually through user notification, user training, installation of hardware, installation of software onto production computers, and integration of the system into the daily processes.";
const maintain = "During the maintance stage, developers handle issues reported by end users. Developers are responsible for implementing any changes that the software might need after depolyment.";
